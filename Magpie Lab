school			How much does school suck?
computer science	Computer science created me!

The keywords are prioritized by the order that the if-statements are written.

Keywords that are inside a different word will still be recognized and the response for that keyword will be given despite the wrong context.

-1 is returned if the substring does not occur in the string.
