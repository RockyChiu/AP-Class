Differences between Alan Turing, Charles Babbage, Bruce Schneier

Bruce Schneier specialized in a different field of computer science than both Alan Turing and Charles Babbage as he focused more on computer security and cryptography. Turing and Babbage are more similar with their interest in programmable computers, but Turing's work is more abstract, revolving around algorithms and the hypothetical Turing Machine. Babbage on the other hand, is credited with the creation of the first mechanical computer.
